# Heartattack_analysis
Python &amp; MySQL-powered heart attack data analysis: uncovering trends in health risks, lifestyle factors, and disease correlations.

# Heart Attack Data Analysis Using Python & MySQL

## Project Overview
This project analyzes heart attack incidences in Germany using Python and MySQL.  
It explores key risk factors such as age, smoking, stress levels, cholesterol, BMI, alcohol consumption, and lifestyle habits, helping to uncover trends and correlations in heart disease.

## Features & Insights
- Heart attack trends by age, gender, and location  
- Impact of lifestyle (smoking, alcohol, physical activity) on heart disease  
- Socioeconomic and healthcare factors affecting heart attack rates  
- Comparison of urban vs. rural heart attack incidences  
- Yearly trends and predictive insights  

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) - Data processing and visualization  
- **MySQL** - Data storage and querying  
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Running the analysis  

## SQL Queries Covered
This project executes 40+ SQL queries, including:  
- Total heart attack cases by age group  
- Top 5 states with highest youth heart attack rates  
- Yearly trends of heart attacks  
- Urban vs. rural comparison  
- Impact of smoking and alcohol on heart health  
- BMI and cholesterol analysis  
- Stress levels and heart disease correlation
